### Problem sets solutions: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science (MIT)

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets of this course (offered by John Guttag). Topics:

- Problem Set 1: greedy algorithms (cow transportation).
- Problem Set 2: random walks (cleaning robot simulations).
- Problem Set 3: Monte Carlo simulations (virus population dynamics).
- Problem Set 4: regression (predicting global warming).
